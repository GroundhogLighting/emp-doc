<div class="textblock"><p>A Glare-compliant model can be any model readable by <a class="el" href="class_glare.html" title="This is the main class within Glare. It manages the Read, Write, Calculate process. ">Glare</a> (through an API or something) and that can be transformed into a <a class="el" href="class_groundhog_model.html" title="The main class, that contains all the Layer, Workplane and much more. ">GroundhogModel</a>. That is, <a class="el" href="class_glare.html" title="This is the main class within Glare. It manages the Read, Write, Calculate process. ">Glare</a> should be able to make a difference between different kinds of objects, surfaces and some other things. For example, it is important to make a difference between a 'normal' surface and a 'workplane'. While the former is meant to be rendered and represents a real surface in the model, the latter is not meant to represent a real surface, but an abstraction of where the user want to evaluate daylight metrics.</p>
<p>Current readable formats are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>SketchUp models (.SKP)</b>: (partially supported) Natively, <a class="el" href="class_glare.html" title="This is the main class within Glare. It manages the Read, Write, Calculate process. ">Glare</a> can read a SketchUp model, from which it gets all the geometry. However, unless generated by using <a href="http://www.groundhoglighting.com">Groundhog SketchUp extension</a>, all materials will be physically incorrect and no workplanes or any other abstractions will be considered.</li>
</ul>
<h2>General information </h2>
<p>Just to keep things simple, there are certain rules that you should follow when extending <a class="el" href="class_glare.html" title="This is the main class within Glare. It manages the Read, Write, Calculate process. ">Glare</a>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>All strings (names of components or surfaces or whatever) should be in ASCII. If you interact with models that do not comply, transform such strings into ASCII.</li>
<li>North points towards the Y axis.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_glare.html" title="This is the main class within Glare. It manages the Read, Write, Calculate process. ">Glare</a> uses the International System of Units (SI). That is, the position of vertices are assumed to be in meters.</li>
<li>The only excepion to the rule above is that all angles are measured in degrees. Even if the degree is not part of the SI, it is accepted by it.</li>
</ol>
<h2>A look inside of a <a class="el" href="class_groundhog_model.html" title="The main class, that contains all the Layer, Workplane and much more. ">GroundhogModel</a> </h2>
<p>A <a class="el" href="class_groundhog_model.html" title="The main class, that contains all the Layer, Workplane and much more. ">GroundhogModel</a> is an object that has several other objects inside. They are:</p>
<h3>Layers</h3>
<p>Layers contain all the geometry of the model. That is, they contain faces, component instances and other geometrical information (each of which reference a material), with the exception of the windows.</p>
<p>It should be noted that each layer has a unique name.</p>
<h3>Component Definitions</h3>
<p>Component Definitions represent groups of <a class="el" href="class_face.html" title="The integration of a Polygon3D and a Material. ">Face</a> (or other geometry) meant to be placed several times in a GroudhogModel. For example, a chair, a table or anything that will be used repeatedly in the model. Component Definitions are referenced as Component Instances within other Component Definitions or in Layers.</p>
<p>It should be noted that each component definition has a unique name.</p>
<p>There is no need of having any views. So, unless you know what to fill this with, just leave it empty.</p>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<h3>Views</h3>
<p>Some 3D modelling tools allow saving predefined views (sometimes known as cameras, scenes or other). A Groundhog Model allows storing such views, requiring as input:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Point of view</li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_view.html" title="Represents a view point, view direction, field of view and type of view. ">View</a> direction</li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_view.html" title="Represents a view point, view direction, field of view and type of view. ">View</a> up</li>
<li>Horizontal field of view</li>
<li>Vertical field of view</li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_view.html" title="Represents a view point, view direction, field of view and type of view. ">View</a> Type (parallel or perspective)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no need of having any views. So, unless you know what to fill this with, just leave it empty.</p>
<h3><a class="el" href="class_date.html" title="Represents a Date object. ">Date</a></h3>
<p>The current date in the model, containing the Month, Day, Hour and Minute.</p>
<p>If not available, do not change it. The default date when a new model is crated is January 1st, 12:00.</p>
<h3>North correction</h3>
<p>Some 3D modelling tools allow the user to choose where North is, thus the North Correction is a number that indicates the real north of the model.</p>
<p>A positive north correction will 'rotate the model' counterclockwise. That is, a window facing North in the original model will look Nort-West after correction. In other words, a positive 45 degree north correction means that the true north points on direction (1,1,0).</p>
<p>If not available, default to 0.</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<h3>Workplanes</h3>
<h3>Photosensors</h3>
<h3>Window Groups</h3>
<h3><a class="el" href="class_weather.html" title="Represents a whole weather. ">Weather</a></h3>
<h3>Options</h3>
<h3>Observers</h3>
<h3><a class="el" href="class_location.html" title="Represents a Location. ">Location</a></h3>
<p>Contains information about Longitude, Latitude, Timezone, etc.</p>
<p>If not available, do not change it. The default location is 0°N, 0°W, on timezone GMT+0. Name of city and country will be 'not specified' </p>
