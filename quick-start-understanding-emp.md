# Quick start: understanding Emp

## Introduction

Emp always receives two inputs: a **model** file and a **script** file. The former is meant to provide a basis of geometry, materials, location, weather and other things; while the latter is meant to perform actions and calculatons over this basis.

```bash
emp model script.lua [arguments]
```

An example of this could be

```bash
# This line of code will test if
emp - hello
```

Then emp should answer

```bash
hello!
```
