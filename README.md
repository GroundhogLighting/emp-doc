Hello, and welcome to the Emp documentation. 

This document intends to help you understand what is Emp, how to use it, and how to understand it as well as possible. However, this is not a book, but a gitbook. That means that **you can help keep the documentation up to date, clean, and complete.** This sort of help is as useful as programming, so please do that.

Thanks for your interest! I hope Emp is useful to you.
