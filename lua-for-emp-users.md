# Lua for Emp users

According to [Lua](https://www.lua.org/)'s website, 

> Lua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.

What that means is that Lua is a pretty powerful programming language. As you will quickly find out browsing the internet, it is hard to choose "the best" programming language. However, Lua was chosen in this project because it is simple enough and easy to include \(from a programming point of view\). Also, it is stable, well documented and works on Windows, macOS and Linux and more and more.

The following sections help you learn some of the Lua basic applications. There is much more accurate \(and formal\) information in [the official Lua reference manual](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html). This sections only intend to give you an idea of how Lua works.
